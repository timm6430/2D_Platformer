This is my senior project that myself and another senior classmate worked on.

We created a 2D platformer video game using C# and Unity. I created multiple enemies, items, a combat system and inventory system. 
It is a short game with a couple of puzzles that the player needs to complete to beat the game.
The game currenctly does not run but here is a link to our trailer
